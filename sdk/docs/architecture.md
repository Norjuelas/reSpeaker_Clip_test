# SDK architecture

`sdk/` is a new, installable package.  It does not import, move, or modify
`applications/clip/tests`, which remains available as the legacy test and tool
collection.

ClipClient
  ├─ typed current-firmware AT commands
  ├─ command lock (one outstanding request)
  └─ streaming download coordinator
       └─ FileReceiver
            ├─ .opus.part writer
            ├─ byte count + CRC32 validation
            └─ atomic rename to .opus

BaseTransport
  ├─ BleTransport   optional bleak dependency; GATT notifications
  └─ UdpTransport   standard-library asyncio datagrams
```

The command lock is a protocol requirement, not a convenience: device responses
do not contain a request ID.  If a command times out, the transport becomes
desynchronized and requires disconnect/reconnect before another command can be
sent.  This deliberately prevents a late response from being attributed to a
different command.

Binary transfer frames are handled independently from AT responses.  BLE uses
link-layer reliability and verifies the final per-file CRC32.  UDP additionally
validates each datagram's CRC32 and sends the firmware `FILE_ACK` only after the
complete file has passed sequence, size, and final CRC32 validation.  A failed
UDP file is discarded and NACKed for retransmission; a failed BLE file is a
terminal transfer error.

For hosts that start on BLE, `clip.wifi.handoff_to_wifi()` provides an explicit
control-plane/data-plane handoff: it sends `AT+WIFI=on` over BLE, joins the host
to the returned AP using `nmcli` (Linux), `networksetup` (macOS), or `netsh`
(Windows), then verifies the new UDP route with `AT+GSTAT`. `clip.web` exposes
the same sequence behind its local **Switch transfer to Wi-Fi** button.

The public API is intentionally based on the current firmware command set
(`GSTAT`, `BATT`, `LIST`, `DOWNLOAD`, `WIFI`, etc.).  Removed legacy runtime
controls such as `BITRATE`, `COMPLEXITY`, `NOISE`, `AGC`, and `DEREVERB` are not
emulated or exposed.
